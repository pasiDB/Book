    <h2>How We Ensure Only Free Books Are Available</h2>
    <p>The Shelf is committed to providing only books that are free of copyright restrictions and available in the public domain. We use the following measures to ensure this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We source book data from Gutendex, which provides metadata from Project Gutenberg, a trusted repository of public domain books.</li>
        <li>When querying the API, we explicitly filter for books marked as <strong>public domain</strong> by using the <code>copyright=false</code> parameter. This ensures that only books with confirmed public domain status are shown in the app.</li>
        <li>We do not display or allow access to books with unknown or restricted copyright status.</li>
        <li>We periodically review our data sources and update our filters to maintain compliance with copyright laws and app store policies.</li>
